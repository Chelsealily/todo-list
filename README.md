# ✏️ To do list

<p>This To-do list was a timed technical test challenge which I completed on my _nology course using ReactTs </p>

<h1>Functionality</h1>
<br>
The main functions:
<ul>
  <li><b>Add task input bar and button</b> - entering a task into this bar and then clicking the + button will add your task to the list below</li> 
  <li><b> Checkbox and Delete task button</b> - Once your task is added, you then have the option of marking it as complete by ticking the box or deleting the task altogether by clicking the bin icon</li>
</ul>
