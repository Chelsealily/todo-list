# ✏️ To do list

<p>This To-do list was a timed technical test challenge which I completed on my _nology course using ReactTs </p>

<h1>Components</h1>
<br>
As this was a simple project, I was able to create the majority of it in the App.tsx. (The heading, add task bar and the add task button)
<br> <br>
I did however create the task item list output in a different component so that it would render to the main page and allow for me to access and delete each of the task components individually.

<br>
<h1>Functionality</h1>
<br>
The main functions:
<ul>
  <li><b>Add task input bar and button</b></li> - entering a task into this bar and then clicking the + button will add your task to the list below
  <li><b> Checkbox and Delete task button</b></li> - Once your task is added, you then have the option of marking it as complete by ticking the box or deleting the task altogether by clicking the bin icon
  <li><b>Reset Button</b></li> - this resets the task list to blank
</ul>
